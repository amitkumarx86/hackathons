**Cheque Vlidation System**<br>
Our system is designed to ***retrive and validate*** the information from the Check with 99% accuracy. 
<br>
<br>
**Description of System**<br>
This will be a desktop/mobile app using which we will scan the check and do the following things:<br>
1.  First Get the following things:<br>
		  a.Account Number<br>
		 b.Name<br>
		 c.Bank Code<br>
		 d.Amount<br>
		 e.Check number<br>
		 f.Date<br>
		 g.Type of Cheque<br>
		
2.  Cross check the money in words and digits <br>
4.  Check the signature of person<br>
5.  And then inspect whether cheque is bounced or not.<br>
6.  Then do the submission.
<br>
<br>
**How it will work ?**<br>
We will train our system for handwriting recognition and signature recognitino(using pattern recognition). 
<br>This is a very practical solution with high accuracy because the traning data's domain is narrow.<br>
1. We will get the features(amount in words, amount in digits, signature, bank code, cheque number, date, branch) from the cheque using machine perception.<br>
2.  We will train the deep learning model on these features.<br>
3.  We will then get the matching score using our trained model.<br>
4.  After that we will do validation of following things:<br>
	a.Check validity<br>
	b.Signature Accuracy<br>
	c.Amount matching in words and digits<br>
	d.**Type of Check** <br>
		<br>
**Note**<br>
		We will cover hindi and englist both languages.
